		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>Gather a couple plant specimens (be sure they’re in your own yard or an area where you’re allowed to collect!). The more complete the specimen, the better—include from the top of the flower or leaves to the root, if possible.</p>

		</strong></div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
 <p>Either keep the specimens moist until you’re ready to press them, or press shortly after picking them. Fold the specimen inside a few sheets of newspaper to absorb the moisture, using additional paper for larger specimens. If you have blotting paper, fold that outside of the newspaper.</p>
 <p>Collect a good specimen - all the parts needed for accurate identification. Because you probably do not know what these are, collect as many different parts of the plant as possible - leaves, flowers, twigs, fruit, seeds. For small herbaceous plants, collect the roots and either whole stems or tops and bottoms (leaf shape, size, and arrangement may vary from top to bottom).</p>

			 Step 3: Start layering
		</strong></div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>You can use a wooden, gridded plant press, which allows air to circulate and dry the specimens evenly. If you don&rsquo;t have a plant press, you can use extra pieces of cardboard or plain pieces of wood. Starting with the layer of wood on the bottom, begin alternating cardboard, blotting paper, and then the specimen in newspaper followed by more blotting paper. You can add multiple plant specimens to the same &ldquo;cake,&rdquo; as long as you keep alternating layers! </p>

			<p>Make detailed field notes for the area before collecting the plant. </p>
			<p>Attach a tag to your plants as you collect them. This really helps you remember which plant is which when you are identifying them. Give consecutive numbers to each plant you collect and use the same numbers in your field notebook and on your tag.</p>

			 Step 5: Mount Your Specimens 
		</strong></div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>You will probably want to make your specimens look nice and last well so you will need to mount your specimens.</p>
			<p>Use glue, sticky tape or a needle and thread to attach each specimen to a clean sheet of thin cardboard or heavy mounting paper.			  </p>
			<p>If you use standard sized paper you can store them in a loose-leaf binder for easy access.			  </p>
			<p>The dried plant will be brittle so if it is properly dried, put your mounted specimen in a plastic or paper cover if you will be handling it often, or if it is to go on display.</p>
			<p> Large herbaria need to ensure that their specimens will last for hundreds of years so they must use acid-free paper and special glues and inks that do not deteriorate..</p>
